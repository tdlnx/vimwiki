Getting a basic electron + vuejs app up and running

vue create [project]
vue add router
vue add vuex
vue add electron-builder

That's basically it. You'll see a backgrouns.js file in your src directory
with all the electron config stuff. 

You can also run -> npm run electron:build to build your app and npm run electron:serve to test.

This will get updated as I learn more stuff but for the time being here you go have fun.
